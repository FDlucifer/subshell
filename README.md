SubShell is a python command shell used to control and excute commands through HTTP POST requests to a webshell.  SubShell acts as the interface to the remote webshells.  

This project uses the principle of hiding in plain sight (even over non-encrypted communications).  The goal is minimize attention.  Like numerous malicious tools, they are easy to find once you look.  This project is designed stealthy, not through high-tech means, but by minimizing the triggering of a defenses such as IDS, Firewall, AV etc.

How does it do this?

  - POST requests minmize data in web logs
  - Encoded traffic helps avoid clear text detection
  - Console interface forces a slow down when issuing commands.  Use of a webshell should be deliberate and focused.  Numerous connections may attract attention.
  - Customization of user-agent to help blend in.
  - Valid 404 errors displayed when attemped to connect to shell without 'authetication' information

## Current Features

  - Designed for used agains Windows Based targets
  - Supports shells in asp, aspx, php, jsp
  - Logging of all actions
  - Base64 encoded data send and recevied in POST requests
  - Invalid request generates a legitimate 404 message.
  - Tracks current directory by implementing common commands (cd, pwd, ls, dir)
  - Built in helper commands
  - Simple replay attack prevention.  Uses a token that is only valid +/- 12 hours of current time.
  - 'Authentication' using replay attack prevention

## Python Dependencies
 
 - refer to requirements.txt

## SubShell Console Reference 

Interaction with a remote 'shell' using subshell is similar to a non-interactive shell.  Non interactive commands can be submited and the results displayed.  

If an interactive command is submitted, the command will not return.  Command will display a timeout error.  

| Command   | Description      | Example
|-----------|------------------|--------
|cd         | change directory | cd c:\temp
|command    | Optional command used to issue remote command.  If no other built in command matches, then this command is assumed. | command tasklist
|config     | Show current settings | config
|dir        | directory command | dir c:\temp
|download   | download remote file.  Files stored in ./downloads.  The original file structure is created. | download c:\temp\myfile.txt
|exit       | exit command shell | exit
|help       | Display help for commands | help
|history    | show command  history | history
|ls         | alias for dir | ls c:\temp
|mysql      | Issue SQL command to MySQL Server base on MySQL confiuration | mysql show databases
|mysql_db       | Select MySQL databse | mysql_db mysql
|mysql_password | Select MySQL password | mysql_password password
|mysql_server   | Select MySQL server   | mysql_server localhost
|mysql_username | Select MySQL username | mysql_username root
|ps         | List processes | ps
|pwd        | show current directory | pwd
|python     | drop to interactive python shell | python
|shell      | submit command to local shell | shell ifconfig 
|status     | Show status for Uploads and Downloads | status
|timeout    | display or set the command timeout setting in seconds | timeout 120
|upload     | upload file to remote server. | upload myfile.txt c:\windows\temp\myfile.txt


## API Used to Communicate to web shells

All command submitted to the shell are POST request with a minimu of 2 parameters (sessionid,'command')

POST Parameters

|Parameter  | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|sessionid  |Used to 'authenticate' requests and minimized replay attacks.  Based on current time.  Any request +/- 12hrs will not be allowed.  If the time is off a HTTP 408 will be sent with the HTTP header expires:'timevalue'.  SubShell can use this value to adjust its authentication it sends.|            
|apikey     |used to submit OS commands|
|apikeyd    |Download file from remote host|
|apikeyu    |Upload file to remote host |
|feed       |stores Base64 encoded file.  Used for upload |

## Features Support by Shell Type

|Replay Protection |  x   |   x  |   x  |      |
|Issue command     |  x   |   x  |   x  |  x   |

|404 on GET        |  x   |   x  |   x  |  x   |

  
## Initial Requirements
  - Single command and control server
  - Web shell payloads (3 versions)
    - .jsp, .asp, .aspx
  - Requests/Responses must be obfuscated or encrypted
    - SubShell is currently using base64
  - Web shell features
    - File browsing â€“ (track current directory)
    - File Upload/Download
    - Command execution
    - HTTP POST Requests used for C2 traffic
    - Non-POST Requests render a valid 404 response
